"Antlers" Statamic syntax highlighting for Sublime Text
=======================================================

This started as a weekend project to bring Statamic tag syntax highlighting to Sublime Text. I pulled a lot of the information for this from this ExpressionEngine bundle: https://github.com/fcgrx/ExpressionEngine2-Sublime-Text-3-Bundle and looking at this documentation: http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/extensibility/syntaxdefs.html. In all honesty, I still don't understand why much of the syntax works.

I called this Antlers because it was just fun... I mean, heck... everything about Statamic is fun.

Updates
-------

I'm now doing my best to keep this version up-to-date with the [VS Code](https://github.com/addisonhall/ahdesign.antlers) and [Atom](https://github.com/addisonhall/language-antlers) versions.

Installation
------------

1. Click the Downloads button at the top right of this page.
2. Choose the zip file.
3. Once downloaded, unzip the the zip file.
4. If you're looking at a folder, rename it to Antlers. If you're looking at a set of files, create a new folder named Antlers and put the files in.
5. Copy the folder to the appropriate place (Note that this should work with Sublime Text 2 or 3):

- OS X: ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/
- Windows: %APPDATA%/Sublime Text 3/Packages/
- Linux: ~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages

To do
-----

I still need to add some stuff for the Raven and Bloodhound add-ons (http://statamic.com/add-ons). Statamic version 2 is on the way, and Raven and Bloodhound are now built-in, so the need for this may change.
